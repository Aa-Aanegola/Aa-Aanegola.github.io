# Hello there!
I'm currently working at Goldman Sachs, Salt Lake City as an Analyst for the Marquee Prime Brokerage team. I worked here for a short stint in the summer of my third year of college and I've been full-time since July 2023. My research interests are deep rooted in Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on fair, robust and trustworthy learning. Essentially, I care about the small error margins that most people usually neglect. 


Outside of work and school, I've been playing the violin for over 13 years (check out La Campanella by Tchaikovsky, probably my favorite classical piece of all time), enjoy a good game of basketball, write short stories and poetry (albeit occasionally), and recently got into collecting Star Wars Lego sets but 75192 (the UCS millenium falcon) still hasn't flown into my room :/
