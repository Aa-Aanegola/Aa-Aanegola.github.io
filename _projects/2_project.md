Back when the blockchain was blowing up, [Dhruv Kapur](https://dkapur17.github.io/) and I thought we'd delve into creating smart contracts and learn solidity through a hackathon solution. Loan-Piranhas (there's no loan shark, just several smaller piranhas) was born as a hodge-podge of different technologies from NFT's to serve as collateral to the blockchain to record loan transactions. 
We have a couple cool diagrams and a pretty neat explanation of the project [here](https://github.com/Aa-Aanegola/Loan-Piranhas)
