This epicly named project is my attempt at procedurally generating low-poly trees from scratch using python for Blender (unfortunately I never got round to generating brocolli). It all started with a game development project using WebGL for which I made a bunch of assets but eventually became lazy and used the SAME assets throughout my game. My game was Star Wars themed, and every TIE-fighter (I know the Empire is very regular, but I could've atleast had some shading variation), bit of space debris and "rebellion coin" was the same. After wrapping up this course project in a rush I couldn't rest and had to try my hand out at procedurally generating something - I chose trees for their natural nature.
