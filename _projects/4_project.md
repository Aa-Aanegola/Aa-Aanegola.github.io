Part of the Algorithms Engineering course, I chose this project due to my budding interest in graphs. We implemented the iFUB algorithm for fast graph diameter computation in C++ (nightmarish, I know) and even parallelized it using OpenMP! Since we needed to experiment with extremely large graphs, we also wrote random graph generation algorithms and a way to load graphs from .mtx files. 

In retrospect, this was probably what triggered my interest in graphs and led me to pursue graph learning research.
