While working on the graph fairness project, a teammate and I started creating memes to document our journey. Here's a few of them that I thought were funny. 

I wish there were more star wars memes here too :anguished:

## The first of many

<figcaption>The day we decided to start documenting our journey through memes to kill some time while watching our output file being generated instead of hoping we see better results in silence. </figcaption>

## Python quirks
<figure class="img-container">

<figcaption>When making small implementational tweaks that (at the time) seemed not to change anything leads to much better performance. Pytorch surely does have some weird behavior at times.  </figcaption>
</figure>



## if\(if == elif\)
<figure class="img-container">
<img src="/assets/img/memes/meme-ifs.png" alt="" style="width:30vw;"/>
<figcaption>No we didn't spend a week looking in the wrong place and definitely did not miss that we used if instead of elif in a few places that broke our code. </figcaption>
</figure>



## A battle of perspectives
<figure class="img-container">
<img src="/assets/img/memes/meme-anakin.jpg" alt="" style="width:30vw;"/>
<figcaption>After months of incremental progress and massive leaps backward we finally saw some real results which made me jubilant. My teammate on the other hand had become very used to our experiments failing.   </figcaption>
</figure> 



## The revenge of the Chomu 
<figure class="img-container">

<figcaption>I brought back a 6th grade insult that simply means 'foolish' and we used it to bring comedic relief while writing our paper every night.   </figcaption>
